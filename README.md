# HarvestBuddy README

HarvestBuddy is a prototype command line tool which allows users of the [Harvest](https://www.getharvest.com/) time tracking software to arbitrarily categorize tasks and create per-task hours budgets. It was created for personal use while I was working at [Green River](https://www.greenriver.com/).

# What does it do?

You can...
- Define a total number of hours you'd like to work each week
- Budget those hours to an arbitrary arrangement of groups + categories
- Use the Harvest entry Notes field to tag entries as part of a given category
- Update the time spent per category from Harvest with a single command
- Easily rearrange budgeted hours between groups + categories
