Standardize:
- comboslug parsing (maybe directly in Budget instance?)
- time_budgeted vs hours
- group vs group_slug vs budget vs budget_slug
- output ('> ')

...
- ability to sort summary by any column
- better summary formatting (more space? larger text?)
- command to clear tags from harvest notes (for submission at end of week -- maybe not needed, ask if PMs/HR put notes in client invoices?)
- budget across multiple weeks?
- autocreate found slugs if they don't exist (sync and mv)
- show how many hours a day would be needed in days left
- command to autoround entries in harvest
- table of synced changes when syncing
- highlight sync issues in red (unbudgeted time, time exceeding budget)
