- ability to sort summary by any column
- better summary formatting (more space? larger text?)
- command to clear tags from harvest notes (for submission at end of week -- maybe not needed, ask if PMs/HR put notes in client invoices?)
- budget across multiple weeks?
- autocreate found slugs if they don't exist (sync and mv)
- budget tags/groups to represent projects, non-project-budgets, maybe others?
- show how many hours a day would be needed in days left
